## Points for future review
- Roman Numerals V2 Kata was ended early due to the Kata already being done shortly before picking up the book. It might be worth coming back to review it in future.
- Boolean Calculator was stopped when getting to nested parentheses functionality - Would like to return to this and try again with a better understanding of TDD.
- Game of Life Kata (pg. 63)
- Instrument Processor Kata (pg. 116)
